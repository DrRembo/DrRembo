👋 Hi my name is Emanuel and I am a physicist with enthusiasm for cool science related software projects, outstanding designs and 
useful tec gadgets. 

I believe in Jesus Christ as my personal saviour and as my Light in this dark world.

"Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” (The Bible, John 8:12)
